Title: Raising the Bar

----

About: 

A public transit bus has a roof surface of 340 ft2. The MTA fleet has around 4,500
buses.

If Bus Roots were to be grown on the roof of every one of the 4,500 buses in the
MTA bus fleet, we would have 35 acres of nomadic green space in the city.

This would be the equivalent of 4 Bryant Parks in New York City.
