Title: Water

----

About: 

The design of the installation is meant for water to be used
quickly by the plants and let the rest flow or evaporate.

The whole installation is suspended above the roof to avoid blocking the original flow of water. 

By allowing air to flow between the roof and the plants, any risk of rust is also prevented.
