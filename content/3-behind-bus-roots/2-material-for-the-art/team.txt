Text: As an Artist in Residence for Materials for the Arts, Marco Antonio Castro Cosio proposes to install a lightweight garden on the roof of one of MFTA’s box trucks. This will be a 8-month pilot project in which the artist will take care of the garden and will use it as an experimental garden to study the difference between a “green roofed” truck and non “green roofed” one. Some of the important metrics to study are temperature, rain capture, growth of the plants, and change in fuel usage.
